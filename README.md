Hi, I'm Bruno Clappe, a French IT student at CESI Engineering School. I prefer developing softwares rather than doing network or system tasks even if I'm not against it.

This is why I develop using { Java } and () => { Javascript }. Greatly interested in writing good and maintainable code, I focus myself on flexibility, performance and optimization. 
I try to find the right balance between them.

I like open source software and want to participate in one or more.

I am constantly learning new things and gaining new skills as I want to be sharp on my domain.

If you want to reach me, just send an email to :
